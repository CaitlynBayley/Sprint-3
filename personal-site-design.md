    <h3>What is your site's primary purpose?</h3>
        <p> The site's purpose is to create a hub to communicate my personal and technical development throughout the Dev Academy course.  This is where I will share my reflective blog entries as well as apply the technical knowledge I am learning from each stage.
        </p>
    <h3>Who is your target audience?</h3>
        <p>My target audience would be my peers from the cohort I am working with. By regularly sharing updates on Slack we can learn and support each other with what we are each creating.
        </p>
    <h3>How do you want site visitors to interact with your site? What experience would you like them to have?</h3>
        <p>Yes I would.  It would like them to access what I have written, but to also get respond to the interface in a playful way that demostrates what I like aesthetically.  I am responsive to colour and imagery and would like to use this to compliment the content I create.  I would like the site visitors to leave with a good idea about what knowledge I have and what I respond too.
        </p>   
    <h3>How will you build your site to support your desired user experience?</h3>
        <p>I would like to draw from visuals from other websites.  I already have the content I need so will just need to lay out the shapes, colours and imagery I would like to include.
